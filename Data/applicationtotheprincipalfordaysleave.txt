Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request for [number] days of leave from [start date] to [end date]. I have a personal reason that requires my attention and I need to take time off from my academic responsibilities during this period.

I have tried to minimize the impact on my studies and have made arrangements to catch up on any missed work as soon as possible. I will ensure that my assignments and projects are completed on time and my attendance does not suffer in the long run.

I would be grateful if you could approve my leave application. If there are any concerns or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am available to discuss this further if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
