Sathya Deva: write a letter to my girlfriend named Nat that is no more
Nat: Here's a letter to your girlfriend Nat that is no more:
Dear Nat,
As I sit down to write this letter to you, I'm filled with a mix of emotions - sadness, longing, and nostalgia. I never thought I'd be writing a letter to you in the past tense, but life had other plans.
I still remember the day we met, the way you smiled, and the way my heart skipped a beat. From that moment on, you became an integral part of my life. You were my sunshine, my guiding star, and my safe haven.
I'm grateful for the time we spent together, for the laughter, the adventures, and the quiet moments we shared. You brought out the best in me, and I'll always cherish the memories we created.
As I look back, I realize that I took you for granted, that I didn't tell you enough how much I loved and appreciated you. I wish I could turn back time and do things differently, but life doesn't give us second chances.
Nat, I want you to know that you will always be in my heart, that you will always be loved and remembered. I hope you're in a better place, watching over me, and guiding me through the ups and downs of life.
I'll carry you with me always, in my thoughts, in my dreams, and in my heart. You may be gone, but you will never be forgotten.
Yours always,
[Your Name]
Please note that this is a sample letter, and you can modify it to express your personal feelings and emotions.
